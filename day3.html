I went down to the river,<br>
   I set down on the bank.<br>
I tried to think but couldn’t,<br>
   So I jumped in and sank.<br>
        </pre>
<pre>

I came up once and hollered!<br>
   I came up twice and cried! <br>
If that water hadn’t a-been so cold<br>
   I might’ve sunk and died.<br>

   from a crack in the concrete?<br>
Proving nature’s law is wrong it<br>
   learned to walk with out having feet.<br></pre>
